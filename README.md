# fitexplorer
Google Fit api exploration

Uses the [Google API Ruby Client](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client) and heavily based on the Calendar API sample in [Google API Ruby Client Samples](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client-samples/tree/master/calendar)

Follow the instructions in the Calendar sample to set up an application and download the client secrets JSON (a dist version of which is included here)

If you're deploying to heroku, modify the set_heroku_environment.sh with your details from the client secrets JSON

A copy is deployed on Heroku at http://gfitexplorer.herokuapp.com/
